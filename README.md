Hey, Thank You whoever you are for using my program!
This code was started in January 2024. Originally I thought that this was a fun project and I hope that the work I have put in becomes great!
Originally I wanted it to be some sort of Knock Off Google Maps but using a graph.

Thank you to the creators of the time and sys modules as the code would have been a lot harder to make.
Also, thanks to https.learnpython.com as I borrowed and modified some code for them to make the car class
