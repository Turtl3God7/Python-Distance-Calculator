# Hey there!

Thank You whoever you are for using my program!
This code was started in January 2024. Originally I thought that this was a fun project and I hope that the work I have put in becomes great!
Originally I wanted it to be some sort of Knock Off Google Maps but using a graph.
This is my first time creating code for others, and I would love it if you guys give criticism.

## Requirements

There are 5 modules that need to be installed from PYPI for this program to work. To install these, you can either type into your command line:

### Windows

| Method 1 | Method 2 |
| --- | --- |
| ```pip install -r requirements.txt```|```pip install bs4```|
|| ```pip install prettytable```|
|| ```pip install urllib3```|
|| etc.|

## Conversion Rates

In the code, I use different units of measurement across the code.
The unit blocks are supposed to represent a normal city block and they are 1/20th x 1/20th of a mile(0.08 km x 0.08 km).

- [Sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#module-sys)
- [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os)
- [Sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3)
- [RE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re)

### PyPI Modules

- [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)
- [Urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

Because of their work, the code would have been a lot harder to make.
Also, thanks to [@Magnus-Thomsen](https://github.com/Magnus-Thomsen) for the SQL database and I have his GitHub linked.

Note: This is my first-ever time releasing code on GitHub and any suggestions from passersby would be helpful!
