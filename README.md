Hey, Thank You whoever you are for using my program!
This code was started in January 2024. Originally I thought that this was a fun project and I hope that the work I have put in becomes great!
Originally I wanted it to be some sort of Knock Off Google Maps but using a graph.
This is my first time creating code for others, and I would love it if you guys give criticism.

Requirements:

There are 2 modules that need to be installed from PyPl for this program to work. To install these, you can either type into your command line (Windows):

pip install -r requirements.txt

or

pip install bs4
pip install prettytable


Notes:

This code is kinda weird because I use different units of measurement across the code.
The unit blocks are supposed to represent a normal city block and they are 1/20th x 1/20th of a mile.

Credits:

Thank you to the creators of the time, sys, os modules and many other modules used in the code as the code would have been a lot harder to make.
Also, thanks to https.learnpython.com as I borrowed and modified some code for them to make the car class
Also, thanks to @Magnus-Thomsen for the SQL database from code. I have linked his GitHub below and go check him out!
