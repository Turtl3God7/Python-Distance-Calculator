# Hey!

Thank You whoever you are for using my program!
This code was started in January 2024. Originally I thought that this was a fun project and I hope that the work I have put in becomes great!
Originally I wanted it to be some sort of Knock Off Google Maps but using a graph.
This is my first time creating code for others, and I would love it if you guys give criticism.

# Requirements:

There are 5 modules that need to be installed from PyPl for this program to work. To install these, you can either type into your command line (Windows):

pip install -r requirements.txt

_or_

pip install bs4

pip install prettytable

pip install urllib3

etc.

# Conversion Rates:

In the code, I use different units of measurement across the code.
The unit blocks are supposed to represent a normal city block and they are 1/20th x 1/20th of a mile(0.08 km x 0.08 km).

Because of their work, the code would have been a lot harder to make.

Note: This is my first ever version of releasing code on Github and any suggestions from passerbyers would be helpful!
