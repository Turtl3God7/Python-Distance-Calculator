Hey, Thank You whoever you are for using my program!
This code was started in January 2024. Originally I thought that this was a fun project and I hope that the work I have put in becomes great!
Originally I wanted it to be some sort of Knock Off Google Maps but using a graph.

Notes:

This code is kinda weird because I use different units of measurement accross the code.
The unit blocks are supposed to represent a normal city block and they are 1/20th x 1/20th of a mile.

Thank you to the creators of the time and sys modules as the code would have been a lot harder to make.
Also, thanks to https.learnpython.com as I borrowed and modified some code for them to make the car class
